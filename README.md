A weather app with scheduled notification

The app first takes the users current location using the geolocation and than after grabbing the lat,lng it finds the exact location (i.e street,place,zipcode,country) using 
Geocoding 
Followed by the local_notification as its initiated it creates the title , body with the same informations retrieved from the geolocation and geo coding and finally uses the 
weather open source api using the lat lng to get the weather and catches the needed informations and forwards to the UI Componenets and the notification .

another dialog is made for the Time Scheduling which is placed on the right corner of the App Bar .
